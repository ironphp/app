## Requirements

IronPHP requires PHP 5.5 or later; we recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.

## Installing IronPHP via Composer

You can install IronPHP as your project using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org)  as
a starting point. you can run the following:

1. Download [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) or download `composer.phar` file.
2. Run `.


If Composer is installed locally, run

``` bash
$ php composer.phar create-project ironphp/app
```

If Composer is installed globally, run

``` bash
$ composer create-project ironphp/app
```

In case you want to use a custom app dir name (e.g. `/myapp/`):

```bash
$ composer create-project --prefer-dist ironphp/app myapp
```

You can directly clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ironphp/app.git myapp
```

Go to myapp dir, if installed with myapp dirname:

```bash
$ cd myapp
```

Go to ironphp dir, if installed without dirname:

```bash
$ cd app
```

If you have cloned or downloaded this repo, then you have to manually create `.env` file and generate `APP_KEY`:

```bash
$ copy .env.example .env
$ php jarvis key
```

You can now use php developement webserver to view the default home page:

```bash
$ php jarvis serve
```

You can also use jarvis by shortcut for *Windows* (only work in cmd, not supported in Windows PowerShell, or Linux/MacOS terminal):

```bash
$ jarvis serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades atleast for NOT FOR NOW, so you have to update for this app-skeleton manually.

You can update The Framework `ironphp/ironphp` easily:

``` bash
$ composer update ironphp/ironphp
```

## Configuration

Read and edit `'Configuraton'` in `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasource'` in `config/database.php`.
